// Earth's current average temperature is 61 degerees
// Fahrenheit. Suppose Earth's temperature rises by 3 degrees every
// year.  Write a function that takes the starting temperature, a
// number of years, and returns the temperature of the Earth after that
// many years have passed.
//
// Do not use any loops or recursion.

// Suppose an animal requires twice as much food
// for every pound it gains. Write a function that takes the starting
// weight of the animal, a final weight, the amount of food the animal
// needs when at the start weight, and returns the amount of food the
// animal needs when it weighs the final weight.
//
// Do not use any loops or recursion.

// A chicken farmer is expanding his coops.  Each year, each chicken
// produces 10 chicks.  He keeps half of all the chicks born that year
// to increase the number of chickens he has.  Furthermore, suppose
// that approximately 1/4 of the chickens die every year (rounded down
// -- e.g. if there are 6 chickens, 1 chicken dies).  Write a function
// that takes the starting number of chickens, a number of years and
// returns how many chickens the farmer has at the end of that year.
//
// You may use loops or recursion.
